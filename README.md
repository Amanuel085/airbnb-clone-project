## Why Design Properties Matter  
Identifying design properties in a mockup is essential for maintaining consistency, clarity, and usability across your application. Here's why it matters:

- **Visual Consistency:** Defined colors and typography ensure a cohesive look and feel across all pages and components.
- **Developer Alignment:** Clear specs bridge the gap between design and development, reducing guesswork and rework.
- **Accessibility:** Proper contrast and font sizing improve readability for all users, including those with visual impairments.
- **Brand Identity:** Consistent design choices reinforce trust and recognition, especially in user-facing platforms like booking systems.
- **Efficiency:** Reusable styles and components speed up development and make future updates easier to manage.
